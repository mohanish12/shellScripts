My Prepared shell scripts

This repository contains shell scripts written by me for different use cases

## words.sh
This shell script promts the use to enter a file name. It then opens the said file and outputs all the words present in it one per line.

## words2.sh
This shell script takes as argument a file name. It then opens the file and outputs all the words present in it one per line

## countWords.sh
This shell script takes as input a filename. It then calls words2.sh using that filename. It then sorts the output and returns the count of each word in the file provided as input
